#
# A logic circuit can be defined as a tab-separated table in a text file. Each
# row corresponds to a gate in the circuit. The main module's circuit_load()
# method will attempt to create a TruthTable object with the specified gates,
# in the order of their listing in the circuit file. Since gates always require
# their output gates to already be defined, the gates must be listed in reverse
# topological order, beginning with the outputs and working backwards to the
# inputs. That is, nothing should be listed as an OutGate unless it has
# already been defined in a previous row as an ID.
#
# The column order is:
#   Name -- Name string for the gate. Must be unique for each gate, and must
#       not contain any whitespace characters.
#   Type -- String name of gate type. Case insensitive. Must be chosen from
#       the following list:
#       OUT
#       IN
#       TRUE
#       FALSE
#       AND
#       OR
#       XOR
#       NAND
#       NOR
#       XNOR
#       NOT
#       DIODE
#       SPLIT
#       SWITCH
#   OutGates -- Tab-separated list of output gate names. The length of the list
#       must be appropriate for the given type of gate.
#   OutPorts -- Tab-separated list of output port IDs. The length of the list
#       must be appropriate for the given type of gate.
#
# Comment lines may be included if preceded by a '#' symbol.
